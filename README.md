# accumulator-demo
A proof-of-concept for stateless Bitcoin nodes, based on the
[accumulator](https://github.com/cambrian/accumulator) crate. Provided totally as-is and probably
will not be maintained, though the authors of this simulation are more than happy to answer your
questions.

## Setup
See the [accumulator](https://github.com/cambrian/accumulator/CONTRIBUTING.md) repo for general
setup instructions. Most probably, you just need to (1) run `setup.sh`, (2) get VS Code, and (3)
install the recommended extensions for VS Code.

## Usage
Just `cargo run`.
